a baseball game model that can output retrosheet database models

This in an old project I started back in 2013.  THere is some good stuff in here, but it needs to get cleaned up and organized.  

The fundamental capability is that you can provide it games information via the gamestate methods and ultimately get retrosheet format database rows out of it.  It depends on sqlalchemy.  

The original purpose was to drive the gamestate with the scraping tools.
